About me
======

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by [Dr. Richard T. B. Ma](https://richard-ma.netlify.app/). 

I am also collaborating with [Dr. Shuhao Zhang](https://shuhaozhangtony.github.io/) for interesting streaming system related topics.

<!-- My research interests are in hardware accelerator, FPGAs, heterogeneous computing, graph processing and database systems. -->
My research interests are distributed stream processing and configurations management. I am currently working on Apache Flink to implement my research proposals.
